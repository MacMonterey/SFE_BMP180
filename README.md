BMP180 Typical Applications GPS Precision Navigation (Dead Reckoning, Up and Down Bridge Detection, etc.) Indoor and Outdoor Navigation Leisure, Sports and Medical Health Monitoring Weather Forecast Vertical Speed ​​Indicator (Ascent/Sinking Speed) Fan Power Control Sports Equipment, such as Altitude Profile The BMP180 air pressure module is a high-precision, small-volume, low-power pressure sensor that can be used in mobile devices. It has excellent performance, with an absolute accuracy of at least 0.03hPa, and extremely low power consumption of only 3μA. The BMP180 uses a powerful 8-pin ceramic leadless chip carrier (LCC) ultra-thin package and can be directly connected to various microprocessors via the I2C bus. Module Wiring Method 1. First connect the chip to the microcontroller (via the I2C interface), and connect as follows 5V—VIN GND–GND A5—SCL A4—SDA 2. Then connect UNO to PC via USB 3. Run the above code
